# Frontend from zero to hero

## 1. Introduction

Hello there! Another week with new challenges. I feel like that this week will be the most interesting of all because you will learn
a great programming language. 

Javascript is the most used language for front-end and each programmer must know how to write JavaScript code and run it in any browser.

Starting off, you will need to read about what is new in HTML 5 and CSS3. There's no rush for JavaScript because it works better with the latest features of HTML and CSS.
