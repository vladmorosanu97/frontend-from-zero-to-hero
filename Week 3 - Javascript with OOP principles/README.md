# Frontend from zero to zero

## 1. Introduction

Hello there! Another week with another challenges. I just think that this week will be the most interesting of all because you will learn
a greate programming language. 

Javascript is the most used language for front-end and each programmer must know how to write code javascript and run it in every browser.

For a start, I want to read some about what is new in HTML 5 and CSS3. There's no rush for JavaScript because it works better with the latest features of HTML and CSS.
