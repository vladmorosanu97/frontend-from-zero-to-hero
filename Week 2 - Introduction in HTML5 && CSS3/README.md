# FrontEndFromZeroToHero - Week 2

## Introduction in HTML5 && CSS3

Hello, it's good to see you here again! :D 

For this week, you will learn some things about HTML and CSS and why Flexbox is the best and most elegant method for layout.

## 1. HyperText Markup Language

The guys at MDN ([Resources for developers, by developers.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) made really useful tutorials for HTML & CSS and this link will provide you some information about this language. 

The most common error people make is believing that HTML is a programming language, which it's false. HTML is a type of markup language. 
It encapsulates or “marks up” data within HTML tags, which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage.
The web browser then reads the HTML, which tells it things like which parts are headings, 
which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc.

Below, I added some links that you have to read, learn and check. As we all know, learning is boring without practice, so the following links will help you first understand the theory, and then resolve the exercises which will come in handy for a better comprehension.

If you think that there is too much information, don't worry! You don't have to learn everything by heart.
Keep in mind that you can try practicing this every day until you will be able to understand all of those things. 

If you have questions or concerns, don't be shy and ask me in a comment! Well, enjoy the reading!

## 2. Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
(there is a good tutorial about XML: [EXtensible Markup Language](https://www.xmlfiles.com/xml/xml-intro/)).

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
