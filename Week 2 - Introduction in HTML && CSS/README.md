## Introduction in HTML

Hello, it's good to see you here again :D 

For this week, you will learn some things about HTML and CSS, what is new in HTML5 & CSS3 and why the Flexbox is the best and elegant method for layout.

## 1. HyperText Markup Language

The guys at MDN ([Resources for developers, by developers.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) made very good tutorials for HTML & CSS and here you will read some informations about this language. 

To be specified that HTML is not a programming language, HTML is a type of markup language. 
It encapsulates, or “marks up” data within HTML tags, which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage.
The web browser then reads the HTML, which tells it things like which parts are headings, 
which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc.

Below, I put some links that you have to read, learn and check. As we know all that the learning is borring without practice, 
in next links you can see and resolve exersises about what you will learn.

If you think that there are more informations, don't worry. You don't have to learn by heart.
Keep in mind that think exist and  you'll be back to it when you need.

If you have questions or concerns, don't be shy and ask me in a comment! Well, happy reading!

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
