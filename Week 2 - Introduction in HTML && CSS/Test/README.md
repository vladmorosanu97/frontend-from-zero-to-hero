## Test 2 - HTML && CSS

Hello! I'm glad to see you managed to get this point and read all of the links I've shared for HTML and CSS. From now on, things should go much faster. Below, you have a quick tests to freshen up your knowledge, one for HTML and another one for CSS. If you don't know the answer to a question, you can look it up into the Solutions folder for each part.

Good luck! :D
