## Test 2 - HTML && CSS

### 1. HTML Questions


1. What is HTML?

    * HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a language of World Wide Web. It is a **standard text formatting language** which is used to create and display pages on the Web
    
2. What are Tags?

    * HTML tags are composed of three things: **opening tag**, **content** and **ending tag**. Some tags are unclosed tags. 
    Examples: ``<p></p>``, ``<div></div>``, ``<h1></h1>``, ``<span>``.
    
3. Do all HTML tags have end tag?
  
    * No. There are some HTML tags that don't need a closing tag. For example: ``<image>`` tag, ``<br>`` tag, ``<hr> tag``.
    
4. What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?

    * HTML elements communicate to the browser to render text. When the elements are surrounded by brackets <>, they form HTML tags. Most of the time, tags come in pair and surround content.

5. What is Semantic HTML?
  
    * Semantic HTML is an element which **express its meaning**. In Semantic HTML, tags like ``<b></b>`` for bold and ``<i></i>`` for italic
    should not be used, reson being they just represent formatting, and provide no indication of meaning or structure.
    
    * The semantically correct thing to do is use ``<strong></strong>`` and ``<em></em>`` and will have the same bold and italic effects, while demmonstrating
    meaning and structure. Some of the semantic tags are: ``<footer>``, ``<header>``, ``<nav>``, ``<section>``, ``<article>``, ``<aside>``, 
    ``<figure>`` and ``<figcaption>``
    
6. What is SVG?

    * SVG is the abbreviation for Scalable Vector Graphics and is recommended by W3C for creating vector graphics wich support for interactivity
    and animation. SVG graphics **do not lose its quality** when they are zoomed or resized
    
7. What is ``<!DOCTYPE>``? Is it mandatory?

    * Yes, ``<!DOCTYPE>`` is mandatory. It is used to instruct the browser about the version of our HTML document. In older versions we must include the version of the HTML we are using.
    In HTML 5, it is very much simplified which is just ``<!DOCTYPE>``. 
    
8. What is the difference between ``<section>``, ``<div>`` and ``<article>``?

    * The ``<section>`` element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section in this context, is a thematic grouping af content typically with a heading.
    
    * The ``<div>>`` element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the calss, lang, and title attributes to
    mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.
    
    * The ``<article>`` represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page or site and that is, in principle, 
    independently distributable or reusable. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a comment or any other independent item of content
