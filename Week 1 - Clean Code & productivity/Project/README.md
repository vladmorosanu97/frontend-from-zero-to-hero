## FrontEndFromZeroToHero - Week 1

# A small project

Up to this point, you've learned about clean code and how to be more productive. 

This project is intended to implement your knowledge and for that you have to create your own to-do list for next week.

Your list must contain your targets for the next days and other daily tasks. Don't panic if you don't end up completing all of your tasks or if your plans change. You can improve this list whenever you get the chance. :D
