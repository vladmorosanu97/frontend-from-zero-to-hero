## 2. Clean Code

If you want to become a good programmer, you have to know that 80% of the time a programmer reads someone else's code and the last 20% of the time he writes his own code. 

*Programming is an art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.* -Donald Knuth

Whether you're writing a code for yourself or for other people, it is your responsability to maintain your project clean and organized.
There are some articles which explain why a clean code is important and show you how to keep your code organised. There are also rules and tips on how to improve your writing.

## 3. Modern web templates

Nowadays there are so many HTML5 & CSS3 templates that they're starting to look alike because/with the help of Wordpress. But web development evolved so much in the last twenty years, and so did the web design. Further, you'll see the differences between old web templates and modern web templates.

**Old sites:** [www.info.uaic.ro](https://www.info.uaic.ro/bin/Main/) or [www.bcu-iasi.ro](http://www.bcu-iasi.ro/) 

**Modern sites:**  [obizzi.com](http://obizzi.com/) or [handelarchitects.com](https://handelarchitects.com/) 

If you want to see more web templates, you can follow this link: [templated.com](https://templated.co/). There are a lot of examples about how a website should look like.


## 4. Setup environement

For these courses you'll be needing github to take the tests and post your projects. It will be much easier for me to revise your solutions and for you to familiarize yourself with this environement.

1. If you don't have an account on github, you need to create one [**github.com**](https://github.com/)

2. You'll use command line to post your solutions and you'll need this: [**git**](https://git-scm.com/).
It's important to bare in mind that git and github aren't the same. **Github** is an application for storing data like a hard disk or database and **git** is the tool to control data or send your code on github. 

3. Once you downloaded git, open the console in your folder dedicated only for one single project. For example, this is my folder for work:  ``D:/Work/FrontEnd/WebProject``  

4. Next, you must tell git who you are. Remember that these commands are used for configuration git. If you typed them already, you don't have to write again.

```javascript 
    git config --global user.name "Your name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail@email.com"
 ```
    
   
 That's great! You finished your first course and I'm proud of you! Now, all you need to do is to solve a quick test and after that you will learn even more amazing information. Have a nice day!
