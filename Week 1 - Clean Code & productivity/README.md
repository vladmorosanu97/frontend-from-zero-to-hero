## 4. Setup environement

For this eight courses you'll use github for solve test and post your projects. It's easy for me to revise your solutions and you must familiarize yourself with this environement.

1. If you don't have an account on github, you must have to create one [**this**](https://github.com/)

2. You'll use command line for post your solutions and for that you require [**git**](https://git-scm.com/).
It's important to note that the git and github aren't the same. **Gitbuh** is an application for storing data like a hard disk or database and **git** is the tool to control data or send your code on github. 

3. Once you downloaded git, open the console in your folder dedicate only for one project. For example, this is my folder for work:  ``D:/Work/FrontEnd/WebProject``  

4. For next, you must tell git who you are: 
```javascript 
    git config --global user.name "Your name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail@email.com"
 ```
  Remember that this commands are used for configuration git. If you typed they already, you don't have to write again.
