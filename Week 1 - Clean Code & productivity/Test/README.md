# FrontEndFromZeroToHero - Week 1

## The first test

1. For next, you will use github for post your solution of this test. The steps are simple:

    * You need to create a workspace on your account. This is a link: **https://github.com/new**
    
    * Open you folder in your computer where you are working for this project. Remember, one folder for one dream ;)
    
    * Now, let rigth click, open git bash and type `` git init `` . This comand means that you will create a local workspace in your computer. 
    
    * You need to create a connection between your local workspace and github. Type `` git remote add origin https://github.com/yourAccount/yourRepositoryName.git ``
    
    * For hold things organised, it's necessary to create a new folder for every course. Type ``mkdir yourFolderName`` and ``cd yourFolderName``
    
    * Below, you can create a new file text or other type of file and let insede your solutions. 
    
    * There is only one spet. To synchronise your local data in your online repository: 
        * ``git add *`` to add files in new commit
        * ``git commit -m "Your optional comment about this commit"`` . This command will create a new local commit with your files.
        * ``git push origin master`` for upload you local commit on github.
       
    If you want to learn more about github and git, there is a good article about this powerfull technology: 
    * [Learn the workings of Git, not just the commands](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/d-learn-workings-git)

2. The best way to be productive and accomplish everything you set out to do is to create your own **To-Do Lists**. What kind of spin do you think is most correctly?  
    
    * a)
        * 10:20 AM:  To clean the house.
        * 3:40 PM:   To go out.
        * 11:30 PM:  Go to bed.
        
    * b) 
        * To clean the desk and make my bed.
        * To walk the dog and go to the market.
        * Make a to-do list for next day and go to bed early.
        
    * c)
        * 10:00 AM:  To clean the desk and make my bed.
        * 3:40 PM:   To walk the dog and go to the market.
        * 11:30 PM:  Make to-do list for next day and go to bed early.
   
3. After some hours of learning is recomanded to take a brake for 10 - 20 minutes. What you think could be this value?
    * a) after every 30 minutes of learning.
    * b) after every 2 hours of learning.
    * c) after 6 hours of learning.
    
4. What is wrong with this code? Could you improve it? If you don't have any knowledge about basic JavaScript, don't worry. You will learn this language soon. This exercise is optional. 
 
 ```javascript
 function myCompany() {
    let hoursOfWork = 30;
    let salary = 2000;
    let firstEmplyer;
    let secondEmployer;
    
    //calculate salary for each employer
    firstEmployer = (salary + 100)/hoursOfWork;
    secondEmployer = (salary + 100)/houseOfWork;
}
```
5. Naming convension is very important for a clean code because the other programmers will not spent much time trying to understand what were you thinking. You need to imporve this code is such way to be more readable by other people. Hint: Try to know that this code are doing.

```javascript
        for(i=0;i<10;i++) {
    d = d +i;
  }
```
