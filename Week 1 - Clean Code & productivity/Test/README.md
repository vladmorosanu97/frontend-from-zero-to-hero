## A little test

    * a) after every 30 minutes of learning.
    * b) after every 2 hours of learning.

 3. What is wrong with this code? Could you improve it? If you don't have any knowledge about basic JavaScript, don't worry. You will learn this language soon. This exercise is optional. 
 
 ```javascript
 function myCompany() {
    let hoursOfWork = 30;
    let salary = 2000;
    let firstEmplyer;
    let secondEmployer;
    
    //calculate salary for each employer
    firstEmployer = (salary + 100)/hoursOfWork;
    secondEmployer = (salary + 100)/houseOfWork;
}
```
3. Naming convension is very important for a clean code because the other programmers will not spent much time trying to understand what were you thinking. You need to imporve this code is such way to be more readable by other people. Hint: Try to know that this code are doing.

```javascript
    for(i=0;i<10;i++) {
        d = d +i;
    }
```
